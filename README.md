# Working stage
1. Support basic operation i.e. add, mul, or, and, sub, lw, sw and beq
2. Pipeline Registers between stages
3. Implement Forwarding Unit
4. Stall one cycle for data dependency caused by lw
5. Implement Hazard Detection Unit for control hazard

# Finished work
1. Implement basic modules, i.e. Adder.v, ALU.v, ...
2. Connect wire in CPU.v
3. support basic command
4. connect wire between stage and pipeline register in CPU.v 

# TODO List
2. Implement Pipeline Registers
