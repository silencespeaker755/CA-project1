# Working stage
1. Support basic operation i.e. add, mul, or, and, sub, lw, sw and beq
2. Pipeline Registers between stages
3. Implement Forwarding Unit
4. Stall one cycle for data dependency caused by lw
5. Implement Hazard Detection Unit for control hazard

# Finished work
1. Implement basic modules, i.e. Adder.v, ALU.v, ...
1. Connect wire in CPU.v

# TODO List
1. Check whether the wires in CPU.v works(we have testdata to use)
2. Implement Pipeline Registers between stages
